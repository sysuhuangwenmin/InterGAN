# InterGAN
## Introduction
This is the project site of Interactive Generative Adversarial Networks with High-Frequency Compensation for Facial Attribute Editing
![result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysuhuangwenmin/InterGAN/main/images/result.png)
Some facial examples of single and multiple attribute editing generated by the proposed InterGAN.

## Model
![InterGAN](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysuhuangwenmin/InterGAN/main/images/InterGAN.png)
 The network architecture of the proposed InterGAN, which consists of five different components: the encoder $E$, high-frequency compensation module HFCM, bottleneck AdaIN blocks, two decoders $D_e$ and $D_r$, and the cross-task interaction  CTI$_i$ ($i=1,2$). $\circleddash$ and $\otimes$ denote element-wise subtraction and concatenation, respectively.
![CTI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysuhuangwenmin/InterGAN/main/images/CTI.png)

Structure of the CTI$_i$ module ($i=1,2$). (a) and (c) are conditional translation, and (b) is style translation. $\bm\circleddash$ and $\bm\otimes$ denote element-wise subtraction and concatenation, respectively.


![HFCM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sysuhuangwenmin/InterGAN/main/images/HFCM.png)
Comparison on the proposed InterGAN with and without HFCM. (a) Input image. (b) Reconstruction image of InterGAN without HFCM; (c) Difference between (a) and (b);  (d) Difference between the input image and the reconstruction images with InterGAN.
